# KISS Fuzzer Bug Bounty Program

The KISS Fuzzer Bug Bounty Program is simple:  
If you find a real security issue and report it responsibly, we will send you exclusive project swag as a thank-you. There are no complicated severity levels or point systems. The goal is to keep it straightforward and focus on community contribution.
