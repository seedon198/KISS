# Security Hall of Fame

This is where I’ll give a shoutout to anyone who finds security issues in KISS Fuzzer and shares them responsibly. Right now there’s nobody here because the project is still super new — you could literally be the first.

## Hall of Fame Members

Nobody yet.  
If you find something and report it properly, I’ll put your name here (or keep you anonymous if you prefer).

---

## How to Get In Here

Pretty simple:
1. Find a bug (security-related, not spelling mistakes).
2. Send me a proper write-up (enough so I can reproduce it).
3. I’ll confirm it and send you some swag.
4. Your name goes here forever (if you want).

---

## Swag?

Yeah, I don’t do cash rewards, but I’ll send you something cool like stickers, a shirt, or whatever I have lying around. It depends on what I have in stock — this isn’t some huge company program.

---

## What If I Don’t Fix It?

Sometimes I might decide the issue isn’t worth fixing right now. This is open source, so you’re welcome to fix it yourself if it bothers you. If it’s serious enough, I’ll try to patch it ASAP.

## Reporting Timeline

I’ll try to follow this:

| Step              | Timeframe (rough)   |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Acknowledge report | ~48 hours          |
| Validate issue     | 5–10 days           |
| Send swag info     | 2–4 weeks shipping  |

But honestly, it’s just me here, so it might be slower if life gets in the way.

## Contact

- Open an issue (if it’s not sensitive)  
- Or email me: security@kissfuzzer.dev  
- Or just ping me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kiss-fuzzer) (if I’m around)

That’s it. No forms, no crazy process. If you help secure the project, you get credit and some swag. Easy.
