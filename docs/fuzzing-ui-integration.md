# KISS Fuzzer UI Integration v0.9.0

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the advanced JTAG fuzzing engine with the KISS Fuzzer UI system, providing interactive access to fuzzing commands through the device interface.

## Features Added

### 1. Fuzzing Menu Integration

Added a new "Fuzzing" menu to the main UI with the following options:

- **Pin Discovery** - Automatic JTAG pin detection with confidence ratings
- **Random Fuzz** - Launch random fuzzing with 100 iterations
- **Boundary Scan** - Execute boundary scan fuzzing operation  
- **Quick Scan** - Perform a quick JTAG chain scan
- **Fuzz Status** - Display current fuzzing engine status
- **Command Line** - Interactive command selection interface

### 2. Command Line Interface

Interactive command selection system that allows users to:

- Navigate through predefined commands using UP/DOWN joystick
- Execute commands with OK button
- Return to fuzzing menu with BACK button

Available predefined commands:
- `help` - Display help information
- `status` - Show fuzzing engine status
- `discover` - Run automatic pin discovery
- `scan` - Scan JTAG chain for devices
- `fuzz random 100` - Start random fuzzing (100 iterations)
- `fuzz sequential 50` - Start sequential fuzzing (50 iterations)
- `boundary` - Execute boundary scan
- `stop` - Stop current fuzzing session

### 3. UI State Management

New UI states added:
- `UI_STATE_FUZZING_MENU` - Fuzzing submenu navigation
- `UI_STATE_FUZZING_ACTION` - Fuzzing operation in progress
- `UI_STATE_COMMAND_LINE` - Command line interface

### 4. Integration Architecture

The integration follows the modular KISS Fuzzer architecture:

```
UI Layer (ui.c/h)
    ↓
Command Interface (fuzz_commands.c/h)
    ↓  
Fuzzing Engine (jtag_fuzzer.c/h)
    ↓
JTAG Hardware (jtag.c/h)
```

### 5. FreeRTOS Integration

- Commands execute in the JTAG task context
- UI updates through inter-task communication
- Non-blocking operations with progress feedback
- Safe task synchronization

## Usage Instructions

1. **Navigate to Fuzzing Menu**
   - From main menu, select "Fuzzing"
   - Use joystick UP/DOWN to navigate options
   - Press OK to select

2. **Quick Operations**
   - Select "Pin Discovery" for automatic JTAG detection
   - Select "Quick Scan" for basic chain scanning
   - Select "Random Fuzz" for immediate fuzzing start

3. **Advanced Commands**
   - Select "Command Line" for full command access
   - Navigate commands with UP/DOWN
   - Execute with OK button

4. **Monitor Progress**
   - Select "Fuzz Status" to check active sessions
   - View real-time statistics and findings
   - Return to main menu anytime with BACK

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified

- `src/ui.h` - Added fuzzing states and function declarations
- `src/ui.c` - Implemented fuzzing menu and command integration
- `src/jtag_fuzzer.c` - Added missing `jtag_fuzzer_scan_chain` function

### Command Processing Flow

1. User selects command from UI
2. UI calls `ui_process_command()` 
3. Command passed to `fuzz_commands_process()`
4. Command executed via fuzzing engine
5. Results displayed on OLED with status codes
6. Events logged to storage if available

### Error Handling

- Invalid commands show "INVALID ARGS" status
- Engine not ready shows "NOT READY" status  
- Busy engine shows "BUSY" status
- Success operations show "SUCCESS" with details

## Future Enhancements

- Command history navigation
- Real-time fuzzing progress display
- Custom command entry (with text input)
- Fuzzing session management
- Advanced result visualization
- Wi-Fi remote control integration

## Testing

The integration has been tested with:
- ✅ Build system compilation
- ✅ Menu navigation simulation
- ✅ Command interface validation
- ✅ FreeRTOS task integration

Ready for hardware testing and real-world validation.
