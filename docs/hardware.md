# Under the Hood: KISS Fuzzer Hardware üîß

Ever wondered what makes your KISS Fuzzer tick? Let's pop the hood and take a look at the engineering that went into this little powerhouse.

## The heart of the machine

At its core, KISS Fuzzer is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico W - but don't let the "Pi" fool you. This isn't your typical single-board computer. It's a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ running at 133MHz with seriously impressive I/O capabilities.

**Why the Pico W?** Three reasons: it's fast enough for real-time JTAG operations, has built-in Wi-Fi for remote control, and the PIO (Programmable I/O) blocks let us create custom JTAG timing that would make expensive commercial tools jealous.

### The specs that matter

**Processing power**: Dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ at 133MHz sounds modest, but it's perfect for embedded work. One core handles the UI and Wi-Fi, while the other focuses entirely on JTAG operations.

**Memory**: 264KB of SRAM might seem small, but remember - we're not running Chrome here. It's plenty for buffering JTAG data and keeping the system responsive.

**Storage**: 2MB of flash for the firmware, plus that MicroSD slot for all your discoveries. We've seen people fill 32GB cards with interesting findings!

## The JTAG interface that doesn't suck

Most JTAG adapters are either expensive, slow, or both. We built something different.

**Speed**: Up to 10 MHz clock rate. That's fast enough for production work but slow enough to be stable with breadboard connections.

**Voltage handling**: Works with anything from 1.8V to 5V targets. The level shifters automatically adapt, so you don't have to worry about frying your expensive dev board.

**Protection**: Over-voltage protection, reverse polarity protection, and current limiting. Because everyone connects things backward sometimes (we've all been there).

### The connector you'll actually want to use

Forget those tiny 0.05" pitch connectors that require a magnifying glass. Our JTAG connector uses standard 0.1" pitch pins that work with normal jumper wires.

‚îÇ‚îÇ‚îå‚îÄ Pin 3 (TDI) - Green wire

‚îÇ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pin 7 (TDO) - Blue wire
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Pin 8 (GND) - Black wire
```

**Pro tip**: The pins are color-coded and labeled. Red always goes to target power, black always goes to ground. Simple.
